## Holographic Hot Tub

"Yo Charlie," messages Jimmy. "So I managed to secure a hot tub for MHacks, wanna do something with it?"

It is three days before the hackathon at the University of Michigan. This hackathon, a collegiate hackathon at that, is probably the second most prominent collegiate hackathon behind only PennApps. I knew I wanted to do something big at MHacks. I just had to.

I originally wanted to make a heads-up display, specifically for an automotive application. I had acquired all the parts to make it based off someone else's experience doing something extremely similar albeit with a few seven-segment displays instead of a whole seven-inch Raspberry Pi touchscreen. I had been getting everything ready in anticipation for making the HUD, including figuring out how to invert the screen scan on the touchscreen, as the image will be a mirror when reflected on the glass. The glass itself is just a teleprompter glass cut into a small size I wanted that is good enough for now.

Perhaps I could work this into the hot tub hack.

Friday afternoon. The only people coming from my school are me and Chad, and neither of us have cars at school. Lo and behold, I had gone and reserved a rental car beforehand, and I selected a pickup truck for this, as we may need it to transport the hot tub and such.

I call up Enterprise to pick me up from my apartment. They show up ten minutes later with the pickup truck, a Dodge Ram, that I would have when all the paperwork is said and done. Me and the agent drive over to the office and we start getting the paperwork underway.

It turns out that at least this particular region of Enterprise Rent-a-Car does not allow the renting of anything other than sedans, hatchbacks and station wagons to anyone under 25. Me and Chad are both under 25. Welp.

The agents gave me a chance to pick out another vehicle within the policy parked in the lot. Normally when I go rent a car, I pick out a mid-size to full-size car, which in Enterprise terms, which do not even match the actual car classification, are "standard" and "full-size". Sometimes Enterprise's full-size ends up being a mid-size car, like the Ford Fusion, but I have ended up with Dodge Chargers enough times that I have some faith in how they classify things. But anyway, I look around the lot and the largest car they had was a Chrysler 200, a car Enterprise classifies as "standard". I go ahead and pick that one, as I will be taking Chad along with me and we will need as much space as we are allowed to get.

We get the paperwork squared away and off I drive back to the apartment, pack up all my shit and get Chad. Off we go to Ann Arbor.

Me and Chad arrive in Ann Arbor about seven hours later. We had hit some traffic along U.S. Route 23 northbound immediately after its interchange with Interstate 94 on the southern outskirts of town, but this was just rush hour. We make our way to campus, to the designated venue that we would spend our weekend in, to sign in, get some food and figure out teammates and ideas. Once I signed in, I immediately go looking for Jimmy, as I very quickly realised that we were among the only old guard who implement crazy ideas in crazy ways attending this time.
