## Holographic Hot Tub

"Yo Charlie," messages Jimmy. "So I managed to secure a hot tub for MHacks, wanna do something with it?"

It is three days before the hackathon at the University of Michigan. This hackathon, a collegiate hackathon at that, is probably the second most prominent collegiate hackathon behind only PennApps. I knew I wanted to do something big at MHacks. I just had to.

I originally wanted to make a heads-up display, specifically for an automotive application. I had acquired all the parts to make it based off someone else's experience doing something extremely similar albeit with a few seven-segment displays instead of a whole seven-inch Raspberry Pi touchscreen. I had been getting everything ready in anticipation for making the HUD, including figuring out how to invert the screen scan on the touchscreen, as the image will be a mirror when reflected on the glass. The glass itself is just a teleprompter glass cut into a small size I wanted that is good enough for now.

Perhaps I could work this into the hot tub hack.

Friday afternoon. The only people coming from my school are me and Chad, and neither of us have cars at school. Lo and behold, I had gone and reserved a rental car beforehand, and I selected a pickup truck for this, as we may need it to transport the hot tub and such.

I call up Enterprise to pick me up from my apartment. They show up ten minutes later with the pickup truck, a Dodge Ram, that I would have when all the paperwork is said and done. Me and the agent drive over to the office and we start getting the paperwork underway.

It turns out that at least this particular region of Enterprise Rent-a-Car does not allow the renting of anything other than sedans, hatchbacks and station wagons to anyone under 25. Me and Chad are both under 25. Welp.

The agents gave me a chance to pick out another vehicle within the policy parked in the lot. Normally when I go rent a car, I pick out a mid-size to full-size car, which in Enterprise terms, which do not even match the actual car classification, are "standard" and "full-size". Sometimes Enterprise's full-size ends up being a mid-size car, like the Ford Fusion, but I have ended up with Dodge Chargers enough times that I have some faith in how they classify things. But anyway, I look around the lot and the largest car they had was a Chrysler 200, a car Enterprise classifies as "standard". I go ahead and pick that one, as I will be taking Chad along with me and we will need as much space as we are allowed to get.

We get the paperwork squared away and off I drive back to the apartment, pack up all my shit and get Chad. Off we go to Ann Arbor.

Me and Chad arrive in Ann Arbor about seven hours later. We had hit some traffic along U.S. Route 23 northbound immediately after its interchange with Interstate 94 on the southern outskirts of town, but this was just rush hour. We make our way to campus, to the designated venue that we would spend our weekend in, to sign in, get some food and figure out teammates and ideas. Once I signed in, I immediately go looking for Jimmy, as I very quickly realised that we were among the only old guard who implement crazy ideas in crazy ways attending this time.

After we hug and such, Jimmy explains that he has secured the hot tub from the seller on Craigslist and that he attempted to transport it to campus. Jimmy drives a new generation Jeep Cherokee, and it turns out that the hot tub would not fit, even with the back seats all folded down flat. The rear liftgate would not close fully, which in retrospect could be worked around temporarily in this case, but we did not want to bother. We would need to figure out another way to get the hot tub to campus. Or so we thought.

Jimmy also explains that the guy originally priced the hot tub at $100 cash. Apparently Jimmy and our other teammate he dragged along forgot about that memo and did not have all the cash on them, because I guess they assumed he would take a cheque or something else. Turns out, the seller just wanted that hot tub gone in some form and getting the original amount was not a priority. So Jimmy and our other teammate just handed the guy $30 and he let us have it.

But back to the apparently unfolding dilemma on campus. The MHacks organisers relayed back to us that we would not be allowed to have the hot tub on campus, despite it being completely disconnected from any water sources, as University administration considered it a "safety hazard". We were all shocked and dismayed to say the least. We even pleaded to just have the hot tub sitting in one of the parking lots adjacent to the venue and they denied us even that. So now we needed to figure out where to put the hot tub and devise a plan that, in case we would have to put it at some considerable distance away, to do much of the engineering work on campus and only make one trip to the tub for final assembly.

Jimmy walks around the venue a bit in frustration. Somehow he comes across Dave, the founder of MHacks many years ago, just hanging around. He brings Dave over to me and the other teammate and discusses our hot tub hack idea. We explain how MHacks organisers and University administration were being total unreasonable bitches to us and Dave immediately related. Five seconds later, Dave goes, "I'll be right back." Five minutes later, he returns with two residents of a house in downtown Ann Arbor called Shift. The house itself is located in the middle of their fraternity row, but Shift is nowhere near considered or even resembles a frat. They are a house full of hackers, makers and other geeks who like to turn up every so often. Dave explains our idea and our difficulties with organisers and administration to the two Shift residents, and they immediately let us use their driveway for the weekend. Le what?

Delighted, we profusely thank the three people who solved one of the biggest conundrums for us. Now our focus turned to getting the hot tub to Shift. Jimmy goes to call up the seller once more, telling him that we now have a location for the hot tub. It turns out, the seller offered to deliver the hot tub to Shift the next morning. Stoked!

Alright, time for more food and socialising even though hacking has technically already started. There is not much to do until we get the hot tub to Shift besides some preliminary blueprinting, but whatever. More food is always good.

We check the schedule again and we find a onesie meetup at midnight. It is now a tradition at collegiate hackathons where some people would bring and wear their onesies during the weekend, as it serves multiple purposes: they are fun, they keep the wearer warm (as venues and human bodies often times get cold at night) and they are actually comfortable to do things in. Seeing that we would not be getting to implementing stuff until a bit later, I whip out my onesie, a chicken. I originally wanted a shark but there were not any available, and the rooster is my zodiac symbol so second choice it was.

The next morning, I wake up all pasty-eyed as usual to word that the hot tub is now in Shift's driveway. I drive over to check it all out, primarily to figure out all our constraints in what we aspired to do. Oh right, I never told you what we really wanted to do with the hot tub.

Jimmy had the idea where we would connect the hot tub to the internet, allowing for, among other things, remote control of the hot tub. The idea was that, perhaps someone has a very long and stressful day at work. They want to relax in their hot tub as soon as they get home. Water takes a lot of energy and a helluva long time to turn hot. Thus, we would allow the user to remotely activate the hot tub
