## Exhibit: Introducing Moist Soil Management

Two months after getting some interested parties, I announce the formation of Moist Soil Management. This also includes this blog.

I'd really like this blog to provide some insight in what this company stands for and our goings-on rather than just a vehicle for search engine optimisation and buzzwords. For the record, I don't care about the latter two items as much as being able to solve problems and educate folks on all the behind-the-scenes in lawn care, land management and keeping things natural. The crazier the problem, the better. The simpler the solution, the better.

Every so often I'll post something about this industry or my work that might be interesting to me but also to all of you who may consider improving your land use efficiency. Part of why I started this company is to continue providing unbiased insights into problem solving in a variety of different venues and circumstances; this blog will showcase what goes behind the scenes in land use, crop rotation and most importantly, keeping it all moist. There will be examinations into user experience, compatibility with older methods, comparisons with seemingly unrelated facets of life and even the occasional dream about tilling.

And even though it's the dead of winter, the work never stops. I look forward to serving you soon.

Best,
Varun, owner of Moist Soil Management
