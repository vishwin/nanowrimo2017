## Moist Soil Management

It is final exams week for both Varun and I, he at the University of Vermont and I at the Pennsylvania State University. It would be our last finals week during the fall semesters at our respective schools, as both of us have been in the same grade level since the United States educational system started tracking grade levels for students. For me, I would only have exams during the first two days of this week, whereas Varun was occupied the entire week. Most of my "final exams" were in fact final projects that did not need physical submission
