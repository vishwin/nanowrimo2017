## Moist Soil Management

It is final exams week for both Varun and I, he at the University of Vermont and I at the Pennsylvania State University. It would be our last finals week during the fall semesters at our respective schools, as both of us have been in the same grade level since the United States educational system started tracking grade levels for students. For me, I would only have exams during the first two days of this week, whereas Varun was occupied the entire week. Most of my "final exams" were in fact final projects that did not need physical submission, so I could expend more effort in preparing for the three actual exams during those first two days of the week. I forget how many exams Varun had. Perhaps it was one exam per day, maybe two on Monday and then nothing till Friday? Not my nature to inquire here.

Tuesday rolls around. It is mid-afternoon and I am relieved of any more exam taking. My excitement builds for when Varun finally finishes all of his exams so we can have a lot of fun, even though said having fun includes very possibly freezing our balls off for much of the time. Usually if I am free of obligations like this I would ride my bike for a bit just because it is a hell of a lot of time I do not usually have for just longer but not necessarily relaxing trainig rides, but today was simply not that day. Instead, I am busily concocting an algorithm or few of how to efficiently pack my car of all the shit I will need to bring home for this in-between semesters break, including making sure my bicycles get secured on the piece of shit rear rack I have been stuck with without scratching the rear bumper any more than I already have. There is no time to get distracted now.

Well well well. I walk back into my apartment from the exam and almost immediately, that feeling of exhaustion, not unlike that feeling at the end of a 36-hour hackathon, comes flying into my chest as if my roommate fired his pistol straight at it, albeit the bullet would not be a firearm bullet but a sedative meant for brown bears. My bed would only be in the next room over so the temptation only got more real. But screen saver Pacman continued to eat dots and horribly dodge active ghosts as I ponder the consequences of any next move I take. Very quickly, the memories of explaining my odd choice of screen savers to anyone who would even accidentally glance over at my laptop, be it the built-in screen or the 4K monitor on the dock, and having to repeatedly cringe at this screen saver's atrocious ability to escape the easiest of ghost-cornering situations had me sitting down at the laptop instead. Type in my password to unlock the screen saver, and Varun immediately corners me with an instant message.
