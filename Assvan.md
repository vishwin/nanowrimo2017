The Penn State Cycling Club. Let that sink in. Okay, to the untrained reader, that means like almost nothing. But to me, it was a total roller coaster of a club, and despite all the tribulations that happen when people have different personalities and such, I would not trade it for the world.

The spring semester is when road racing season happens. Since the university semester goes between January and May, the road racing season goes between March and May, albeit May being only for one week for National Championships. Penn State Cycling is part of the Eastern Collegiate Cycling Conference, which encompasses schools from Delaware to Maine. Given that the season starts in March with the bulk of it being in the latter month and April, race weekends are often cold, disgusting and dreary. The first two or three race weekends in early March may as well still be considered winter, even though the first half of March *is* still winter. The leg warmers, base layers and anything else to keep warm but not too warm are still out, and only until maybe mid-April do many people elect to ditch them for lighter fare. Alas.

It is now the beginning of April. The race weekend two weeks from now is a combined Dartmouthâ€“University of Vermont production, with the Saturday being on Dartmouth's campus and Sunday on the roads of Charlotte (pronounced Char-lot), Vermont. Our club is under the jurisdiction of Penn State Club Sports, which has rather specific policies for all clubs under its umbrella to ensure the safety of all. I have been a club officer for three years by this point, so I have gotten their shtick every August: the collegiate club sports world in general is a small world, and club sports are the most risky single part of any institution of higher education. It is not like varsity sports under NCAA jurisdiction where everything is tightly scrutinised; club sports are run not much unlike any other non-sport club. Operations are handled almost solely by the club except in cases of emergency, among other things. This includes transportation, for the most part.

Hear me out on this when I say for the most part. But back to the scene at hand. Two weekends from now is Dartmouth/UVM. Club Sports wants a roster and itenerary of the entire trip submitted to them at least three days in advance of departure, but we as a club decided to have that stuff finalised a week and three days in advance to allow for any last-minute changes or adverse situations to be addressed. For this weekend, only me and James signed up. Normally, there would be at least one club member who has a motor vehicle to drive and allow us to live out of for a weekend, as we will have our bikes, accessories, clothes and some study materials in the case we somehow have enough down time to study. But our deadline for the itenerary comes and we are still the only ones signed up. Neither of us have motor vehicles on campus. Fortunately, Club Sports has a contract with the local Enterprise Rent-a-Car office to provide not only discounted rental rates, but allow those booking on Club Sports's account to drive anything necessary. Normally, it is the policy of this region of Enterprise to not allow those under 25 to drive anything other than a car, even if no cars are available on the lot.

I take control of submitting and maintaining the itenerary and other communications to Club Sports, as I am an officer and safety officer. I put down that we will need to rent a vehicle from Enterprise, then I submit the itenerary early so Club Sports cannot initially fault us for not communicating with them, and I go on with my week until their deadline comes up.

It is now Club Sports's deadline.
