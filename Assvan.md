The Penn State Cycling Club. Let that sink in. Okay, to the untrained reader, that means like almost nothing. But to me, it was a total roller coaster of a club, and despite all the tribulations that happen when people have different personalities and such, I would not trade it for the world.

The spring semester is when road racing season happens. Since the university semester goes between January and May, the road racing season goes between March and May, albeit May being only for one week for National Championships. Penn State Cycling is part of the Eastern Collegiate Cycling Conference, which encompasses schools from Delaware to Maine. Given that the season starts in March with the bulk of it being in the latter month and April, race weekends are often cold, disgusting and dreary. The first two or three race weekends in early March may as well still be considered winter, even though the first half of March *is* still winter. The leg warmers, base layers and anything else to keep warm but not too warm are still out, and only until maybe mid-April do many people elect to ditch them for lighter fare. Alas.

It is now the beginning of April. The race weekend two weeks from now is a combined Dartmouthâ€“University of Vermont production, with the Saturday being on Dartmouth's campus and Sunday on the roads of Charlotte (pronounced Char-lot), Vermont. Our club is under the jurisdiction of Penn State Club Sports, which has rather specific policies for all clubs under its umbrella to ensure the safety of all. I have been a club officer for three years by this point, so I have gotten their shtick every August: the collegiate club sports world in general is a small world, and club sports are the most risky single part of any institution of higher education. It is not like varsity sports under NCAA jurisdiction where everything is tightly scrutinised; club sports are run not much unlike any other non-sport club. Operations are handled almost solely by the club except in cases of emergency, among other things. This includes transportation, for the most part.

Hear me out on this when I say for the most part. But back to the scene at hand. Two weekends from now is Dartmouth/UVM. Club Sports wants a roster and itenerary of the entire trip submitted to them at least three days in advance of departure, but we as a club decided to have that stuff finalised a week and three days in advance to allow for any last-minute changes or adverse situations to be addressed. For this weekend, only me and James signed up. Normally, there would be at least one club member who has a motor vehicle to drive and allow us to live out of for a weekend, as we will have our bikes, accessories, clothes and some study materials in the case we somehow have enough down time to study. But our deadline for the itenerary comes and we are still the only ones signed up. Neither of us have motor vehicles on campus. Fortunately, Club Sports has a contract with the local Enterprise Rent-a-Car office to provide not only discounted rental rates, but allow those booking on Club Sports's account to drive anything necessary. Normally, it is the policy of this region of Enterprise to not allow those under 25 to drive anything other than a car, even if no cars are available on the lot.

I take control of submitting and maintaining the itenerary and other communications to Club Sports, as I am an officer and safety officer. I put down that we will need to rent a vehicle from Enterprise, then I submit the itenerary early so Club Sports cannot initially fault us for not communicating with them, and I go on with my week until their deadline comes up.

-----

It is now Club Sports's deadline. The staff over there review and approve everything, including the rental vehicle. We are good to go for our Friday departure.

Friday comes and I go to my first two classes of the day, skipping the third as we will need the time to drive to Dartmouth. I text James to let him know that I will show up with a rental vehicle soon and to get his stuff ready. Then I call up Enterprise so they can come and pick me up from my apartment. I had put down in the Club Sports itenerary that we need at least an SUV to fit all our stuff, as Enterprise does not allow external accessories, including bike racks, on their vehicles. Hopefully Enterprise got that memo.

I remind the Enterprise agent of this need. Unfortunately, he replied with that all the SUVs and pickup trucks had been rented for the weekend and they had next to nothing left on their lot. However, he would call me back if he found anything remotely suitable. I hoped for the best.

Ten minutes later, I get a call back.

"So, does a cargo van work?"

"PERFECT!"

An Enterprise agent comes over to my apartment in a Dodge Charger and we drive to the office. We go through all the paperwork and he walks me around the back where this van is parked. It is a nearly brand-new Chevrolet Express 2500 in white, with the only windows being the front seats and the rear double doors. My excitement builds as I have never driven a cargo van, even though I have driven van chassis-based box trucks. The agent gives me my copy of the rental agreement that also serves as the vehicle registration for the duration of the rental and wishes me a good trip. Once he leaves, I just start bursting out laughing hysterically.

Sitting in the driver's seat, you can tell that this is not equipped like any other vehicle intended for passenger use. The radio is just a plain, very basic, radio with a 3.5 mm port, for headphones or aux. Fine. There is also a three-prong power outlet supplying AC, nice. Then I started looking for a glove box. There is no glove box. The glove box is just the cubby in the centre console. Next I start adjusting my mirrors. Rear-view mirror is just another rear-view mirror. But the side mirrors are a completely different story. I start fumbling for the side mirror adjusters only to find none, and the realisation sets in: I would need to get out and manually adjust all three of those per side with my cold, bare hands. For the driver's side, it was a matter of leaning very far forward and reaching out the window, leaning back into the seat back to check position. The shotgun side, man. Had to wholesale exit the van, walk over to that side, adjust, walk back, check, walk over, adjust, repeat until position is somewhat correct. It will be somewhat easier when I get James in here.

I start to back the van out of the parking spot. There is a column-mounted automatic shifter, fine. Nothing special about that, as I have driven with those multiple times. This column-mounted shifter allows for more space in the centre console anyway, which benefits the white van men out there.

I make my way back to the apartment and I start loading up my stuff. Bike, trainer, duffel bag with clothes, kit, helmets, accessories and tools, and my backpack containing laptop and class notes. Took a couple trips up and down to load everything but it did not take long, in fact I could not take too long; I had put my park-anywhere-you-want lights on in the permit-only parking lot for this apartment so I would not have to walk too far with heavy stuff. I text James that I am coming over to where he wanted me to meet him with the van.

I drive over to the location and wait five minutes until James starts walking over with his stuff. "I did not expect this monster," exclaimed James, even though I told him I had a cargo van. We load up his stuff, but there was one problem with the total load in general.

Remember how I said this van was spartan? This especially includes the cargo area. No rub rails, no holes for tie-downs, no nothing but a rubberised floor. I devise a plan, largely derived from my hackathon experiences, that especially includes duct tape. Thankfully, I had forgotten to remove the large roll of duct tape from my duffel bag from my last hackathon trip nearly a month ago, so that saved another trip back to the apartment to grab it. However, we would need more items to ensure the security of all our stuff, some fragile.

We drive over to our sponsor bike shop. They get deliveries of bikes in cardboard boxes on the regular, as they sell bikes. However, they do not sell said bikes with or in said boxes; they discard them somehow. Knowing this tidbit, I park the van a block away on two-hour residential parking and we walk into the shop.

"You guys have any old bike boxes you're about to throw out?"

"Oh, plenty! You guys can take whatever you need."
