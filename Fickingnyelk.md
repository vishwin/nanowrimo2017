We're calling this "Le Grand DÃ©part".

Rear rack secured to the boot. Check.

Track bike and road bike. Check.

Six days worth of clothes. Okay, so that includes eight shirts, four wearable shorts (one will have to run double duty, but that's fine since nobody will notice), ten pairs of socks, nine boxers and one pair of pants in case it suddenly gets cold as fuck. Fine, check.

Can't forget cycling kits and equipment. Three skinsuits, three sets of regular kit (bib shorts and jersey). Add in the two tote bags of gloves, sunglasses, spare tubes, floor and portable pumps, patch kit. Probably should include the adjustable wrenches in there, although the track may have tools of their own. Oh, and two helmets because I will have created a rain forest after one ride. Check.

Since I will be going to Canada, I will need travel documents. Green card and passport (even though it will not be needed, but who knows what the Canada Border Services Agency will ask for). Keep it in a secure lanyard in my backpack. Check.

And speaking of the backpack, laptop, power supply for the same, phone and watch chargers, cables and external battery pack. Everything cool, everything calm.

Finally, it is Canada 150. Parks Canada gave whoever asked for them free national parks passes in part to celebrate 150 years of confederation. Stick that on the dashboard and not on the rearview mirror, as it is technically illegal to drive with anything on the rearview mirror.

That was probably the most painless checklist in a long while, as I have a tendency to miss even one small but important item in it, in the worst case while driving. I was hopeful not to have missed anything this time.

And again, since this will involve an international border, time to vacuum the car. Don't want the border officers to notice anything that should not be in the car when pulling up to the inspection booth.

Of course the car, as we are rolling along, has some petrol fumes in the cabin. Okay, maybe not of course, as this behaviour is completely abnormal. No one should smell petrol fumes in the cabin.

This only started happening a couple weeks ago. The smell coincided with an increase in engine noise, especially during acceleration and gear changes. Because of this, during the intervening but extremely busy period of mine, I did not want anyone but myself in the car before the problem is diagnosed and a fix designed and implemented.

My initial hunch was an evaporative exhaust leak, as there should not be a smell of petrol fumes at all after the gases pass through the catalytic converter. The fact that those fumes could be smelt meant the catalytic converter was unused.
