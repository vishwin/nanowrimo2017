We're calling this "Le Grand DÃ©part".

Rear rack secured to the boot. Check.

Track bike and road bike. Check.

Six days worth of clothes. Okay, so that includes eight shirts, four wearable shorts (one will have to run double duty, but that's fine since nobody will notice), ten pairs of socks, nine boxers and one pair of pants in case it suddenly gets cold as fuck. Fine, check.

Can't forget cycling kits and equipment. Three skinsuits, three sets of regular kit (bib shorts and jersey). Add in the two tote bags of gloves, sunglasses, spare tubes, floor and portable pumps, patch kit. Probably should include the adjustable wrenches in there, although the track may have tools of their own. Oh, and two helmets because I will have created a rain forest after one ride. Check.

Since I will be going to Canada, I will need travel documents. Green card and passport (even though it will not be needed, but who knows what the Canada Border Services Agency will ask for). Keep it in a secure lanyard in my backpack. Check.

And speaking of the backpack, laptop, power supply for the same, phone and watch chargers, cables and external battery pack. Everything cool, everything calm.

Finally, it is Canada 150. Parks Canada gave whoever asked for them free national parks passes in part to celebrate 150 years of confederation. Stick that on the dashboard and not on the rearview mirror, as it is technically illegal to drive with anything on the rearview mirror.

That was probably the most painless checklist in a long while, as I have a tendency to miss even one small but important item in it, in the worst case while driving. I was hopeful not to have missed anything this time.

And again, since this will involve an international border, time to vacuum the car. Don't want the border officers to notice anything that should not be in the car when pulling up to the inspection booth.

Of course the car, as we are rolling along, has some petrol fumes in the cabin. Okay, maybe not of course, as this behaviour is completely abnormal. No one should smell petrol fumes in the cabin.

This only started happening a couple weeks ago. The smell coincided with an increase in engine noise, especially during acceleration and gear changes. Because of this, during the intervening but extremely busy period of mine, I did not want anyone but myself in the car before the problem is diagnosed and a fix designed and implemented.

My initial hunch was an evaporative exhaust leak, as there should not be a smell of petrol fumes at all after the gases pass through the catalytic converter. The fact that those fumes could be smelt meant the catalytic converter was unused. Furthermore, the increased engine noise levels also mean that the exhaust gases are not going though the resonator and muffler either.

It turns out, post trip, after crawling underneath the car, that the pipe leading out of the manifold and its gasket had a crack. Not too big, but the crack is enough to smell the untreated exhaust gases leaking out of the engine. This also leads to enough exhaust gases to not go through the resonator and muffler!

It was thought to be an easy enough fix, as it was a matter of replacing a pipe. However, upon further inspection of the bolts and flanges connecting the pipes, they turned out corroded beyond recognition. That is sixteen years of original ownership and use in all seasons right there. And there comes yet another problem, how to remove the old pipes while preserving as much of the flanges to install the new pipe on.

After exploring multiple options of repair, including taking the car to a garage and welding a new pipe on, I decided to just get a new flange kit and mount the new pipe to that. If the garage option was chosen, the mechanics there would probably replace the entire exhaust system even though only the one pipe needed replacing just due to all the rust. That would cost too much for little benefit given the age of this car and how already economical its costs of ownership are. So RockAuto it is, ordering the new pipe and a flange kit, waiting for them to arrive, then taking a weekend to chop off the old pipe and ratcheting the new parts in.

Fam, in the automotive repair industry, parts are cheap. Labour is not. Just more motivation to construct a metal shop for myself in the near future.
