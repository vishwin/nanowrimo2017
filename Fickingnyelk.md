## Fickingnyelk

We're calling this "Le Grand DÃ©part".

Rear rack secured to the boot. Check.

Track bike and road bike. Check.

Six days worth of clothes. Okay, so that includes eight shirts, four wearable shorts (one will have to run double duty, but that's fine since nobody will notice), ten pairs of socks, nine boxers and one pair of pants in case it suddenly gets cold as fuck. Fine, check.

Can't forget cycling kits and equipment. Three skinsuits, three sets of regular kit (bib shorts and jersey). Add in the two tote bags of gloves, sunglasses, spare tubes, floor and portable pumps, patch kit. Probably should include the adjustable wrenches in there, although the track may have tools of their own. Oh, and two helmets because I will have created a rain forest after one ride. Check.

Since I will be going to Canada, I will need travel documents. Green card and passport (even though it will not be needed, but who knows what the Canada Border Services Agency will ask for). Keep it in a secure lanyard in my backpack. Check.

And speaking of the backpack, laptop, power supply for the same, phone and watch chargers, cables and external battery pack. Everything cool, everything calm.

Finally, it is Canada 150. Parks Canada gave whoever asked for them free national parks passes in part to celebrate 150 years of confederation. Stick that on the dashboard and not on the rearview mirror, as it is technically illegal to drive with anything on the rearview mirror.

That was probably the most painless checklist in a long while, as I have a tendency to miss even one small but important item in it, in the worst case while driving. I was hopeful not to have missed anything this time.

And again, since this will involve an international border, time to vacuum the car. Don't want the border officers to notice anything that should not be in the car when pulling up to the inspection booth.

Of course the car, as we are rolling along, has some petrol fumes in the cabin. Okay, maybe not of course, as this behaviour is completely abnormal. No one should smell petrol fumes in the cabin.

This only started happening a couple weeks ago. The smell coincided with an increase in engine noise, especially during acceleration and gear changes. Because of this, during the intervening but extremely busy period of mine, I did not want anyone but myself in the car before the problem is diagnosed and a fix designed and implemented.

My initial hunch was an evaporative exhaust leak, as there should not be a smell of petrol fumes at all after the gases pass through the catalytic converter. The fact that those fumes could be smelt meant the catalytic converter was unused. Furthermore, the increased engine noise levels also mean that the exhaust gases are not going though the resonator and muffler either.

It turns out, post trip, after crawling underneath the car, that the pipe leading out of the manifold and its gasket had a crack. Not too big, but the crack is enough to smell the untreated exhaust gases leaking out of the engine. This also leads to enough exhaust gases to not go through the resonator and muffler!

It was thought to be an easy enough fix, as it was a matter of replacing a pipe. However, upon further inspection of the bolts and flanges connecting the pipes, they turned out corroded beyond recognition. That is sixteen years of original ownership and use in all seasons right there. And there comes yet another problem, how to remove the old pipes while preserving as much of the flanges to install the new pipe on.

After exploring multiple options of repair, including taking the car to a garage and welding a new pipe on, I decided to just get a new flange kit and mount the new pipe to that. If the garage option was chosen, the mechanics there would probably replace the entire exhaust system even though only the one pipe needed replacing just due to all the rust. That would cost too much for little benefit given the age of this car and how already economical its costs of ownership are. So RockAuto it is, ordering the new pipe and a flange kit, waiting for them to arrive, then taking a weekend to chop off the old pipe and ratcheting the new parts in.

Fam, in the automotive repair industry, parts are cheap. Labour is not. Just more motivation to construct a metal shop for myself in the near future.

Five hours later and I finally start going west, exiting Interstate 81 and Interstate 476 earlier. I just crossed into Syracuse and now need to make my way to the New York State Thruway. There is just one problem: I am almost out of fuel, as in the fuel gauge is *at* empty. However, I know for a fact that fuel on the Thruway's service plazas will be more expensive than what I can get elsewhere.

I exit onto Interstate 690 west towards the Thruway, also known as Interstate 90, or even *The* 90. I hoped that once deeper in the western suburbs of Syracuse that I would find a reasonably-priced gas station along 690. I had to operate on the guessing game at this point, as I still had my hands on the wheel and feet on the pedals; normally I would check my GasBuddy app to compare fuel prices. Continuing to drive on 690, there were just no exits featuring signs for fuel. Then the sign for the Thruway appeared. I now have two choices: get on the Thruway and fuel up at the first service plaza or continue on Route 690 (the Interstate designation ends at the Thruway) and hope the first exit past the Thruway has fuel.

I choose to stay on 690, now changing to state highway status and north as cardinal direction instead of west. At first I thought an exit would appear soon. It soon becomes apparent that there is some distance, say at least five miles, between the Thruway and the first exit after for Baldwinsville. Huzzah, there is a sign featuring gas stations at the exit, and I immediately get ready to exit and pull into the first one prima facie. Down the ramp, I notice the first sign pointing towards a station after turning left, but then I see an actual station on the right, so I turn right. Then it was an immediate left into the station, but only after sitting in the middle turn lane for a minute.

Fuelling starts. I update the group chat: "fuel stop in Baldwinsville." We have someone from Syracuse in this chat but she generally works night shifts, so maybe she saw that but I doubt it.

Two hours later on the Thruway, the hunger creeps up to me and I pull into the Ontario Service Plaza. Funny, that name is very situationally aware as I was heading to the province of Ontario. I take a picture of the plaque on the building and post it to the group chat.

This will turn out as the last food before crossing the border, as we are just west of Rochester at this point. Buffalo is not too far away, perhaps an hour or so without traffic. Remember that now.

I eye a McDonald's and immediately remember to open their app to check for any deals they may have. Aha! Buy one, get one free large fries. Easy enough to eat off the shotgun seat while driving, right? I mean, just pluck one or a few fries at a time with one hand without having to look at them. And two large fries without anything else will definitely fill me up.

While waiting for my order, I check the traffic leading into Buffalo. My eyes widen. Standstill traffic not too far west of the next service plaza. All before Buffalo. Well it's not like I have much choice, the question becomes do I want to wait till this subsides or just solder on through. I decide to just solder on through, and by that time my order was ready.

17:00. Still sitting in this standstill.
