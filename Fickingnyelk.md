## Fickingnyelk

We're calling this "Le Grand Départ".

Rear rack secured to the boot. Check.

Track bike and road bike. Check.

Six days worth of clothes. Okay, so that includes eight shirts, four wearable shorts (one will have to run double duty, but that's fine since nobody will notice), ten pairs of socks, nine boxers and one pair of pants in case it suddenly gets cold as fuck. Fine, check.

Can't forget cycling kits and equipment. Three skinsuits, three sets of regular kit (bib shorts and jersey). Add in the two tote bags of gloves, sunglasses, spare tubes, floor and portable pumps, patch kit. Probably should include the adjustable wrenches in there, although the track may have tools of their own. Oh, and two helmets because I will have created a rain forest after one ride. Check.

Since I will be going to Canada, I will need travel documents. Green card and passport (even though it will not be needed, but who knows what the Canada Border Services Agency will ask for). Keep it in a secure lanyard in my backpack. Check.

And speaking of the backpack, laptop, power supply for the same, phone and watch chargers, cables and external battery pack. Everything cool, everything calm.

Finally, it is Canada 150. Parks Canada gave whoever asked for them free national parks passes in part to celebrate 150 years of confederation. Stick that on the dashboard and not on the rearview mirror, as it is technically illegal to drive with anything on the rearview mirror.

That was probably the most painless checklist in a long while, as I have a tendency to miss even one small but important item in it, in the worst case while driving. I was hopeful not to have missed anything this time.

And again, since this will involve an international border, time to vacuum the car. Don't want the border officers to notice anything that should not be in the car when pulling up to the inspection booth.

Of course the car, as we are rolling along, has some petrol fumes in the cabin. Okay, maybe not of course, as this behaviour is completely abnormal. No one should smell petrol fumes in the cabin.

This only started happening a couple weeks ago. The smell coincided with an increase in engine noise, especially during acceleration and gear changes. Because of this, during the intervening but extremely busy period of mine, I did not want anyone but myself in the car before the problem is diagnosed and a fix designed and implemented.

My initial hunch was an evaporative exhaust leak, as there should not be a smell of petrol fumes at all after the gases pass through the catalytic converter. The fact that those fumes could be smelt meant the catalytic converter was unused. Furthermore, the increased engine noise levels also mean that the exhaust gases are not going though the resonator and muffler either.

It turns out, post trip, after crawling underneath the car, that the pipe leading out of the manifold and its gasket had a crack. Not too big, but the crack is enough to smell the untreated exhaust gases leaking out of the engine. This also leads to enough exhaust gases to not go through the resonator and muffler!

It was thought to be an easy enough fix, as it was a matter of replacing a pipe. However, upon further inspection of the bolts and flanges connecting the pipes, they turned out corroded beyond recognition. That is sixteen years of original ownership and use in all seasons right there. And there comes yet another problem, how to remove the old pipes while preserving as much of the flanges to install the new pipe on.

After exploring multiple options of repair, including taking the car to a garage and welding a new pipe on, I decided to just get a new flange kit and mount the new pipe to that. If the garage option was chosen, the mechanics there would probably replace the entire exhaust system even though only the one pipe needed replacing just due to all the rust. That would cost too much for little benefit given the age of this car and how already economical its costs of ownership are. So RockAuto it is, ordering the new pipe and a flange kit, waiting for them to arrive, then taking a weekend to chop off the old pipe and ratcheting the new parts in.

Fam, in the automotive repair industry, parts are cheap. Labour is not. Just more motivation to construct a metal shop for myself in the near future.

Five hours later and I finally start going west, exiting Interstate 81 and Interstate 476 earlier. I just crossed into Syracuse and now need to make my way to the New York State Thruway. There is just one problem: I am almost out of fuel, as in the fuel gauge is *at* empty. However, I know for a fact that fuel on the Thruway's service plazas will be more expensive than what I can get elsewhere.

I exit onto Interstate 690 west towards the Thruway, also known as Interstate 90, or even *The* 90. I hoped that once deeper in the western suburbs of Syracuse that I would find a reasonably-priced gas station along 690. I had to operate on the guessing game at this point, as I still had my hands on the wheel and feet on the pedals; normally I would check my GasBuddy app to compare fuel prices. Continuing to drive on 690, there were just no exits featuring signs for fuel. Then the sign for the Thruway appeared. I now have two choices: get on the Thruway and fuel up at the first service plaza or continue on Route 690 (the Interstate designation ends at the Thruway) and hope the first exit past the Thruway has fuel.

I choose to stay on 690, now changing to state highway status and north as cardinal direction instead of west. At first I thought an exit would appear soon. It soon becomes apparent that there is some distance, say at least five miles, between the Thruway and the first exit after for Baldwinsville. Huzzah, there is a sign featuring gas stations at the exit, and I immediately get ready to exit and pull into the first one prima facie. Down the ramp, I notice the first sign pointing towards a station after turning left, but then I see an actual station on the right, so I turn right. Then it was an immediate left into the station, but only after sitting in the middle turn lane for a minute.

Fuelling starts. I update the group chat: "fuel stop in Baldwinsville." We have someone from Syracuse in this chat but she generally works night shifts, so maybe she saw that but I doubt it.

-----

Two hours later on the Thruway, the hunger creeps up to me and I pull into the Ontario Service Plaza. Funny, that name is very situationally aware as I was heading to the province of Ontario. I take a picture of the plaque on the building and post it to the group chat.

This will turn out as the last food before crossing the border, as we are just west of Rochester at this point. Buffalo is not too far away, perhaps an hour or so without traffic. Remember that now.

I eye a McDonald's and immediately remember to open their app to check for any deals they may have. Aha! Buy one, get one free large fries. Easy enough to eat off the shotgun seat while driving, right? I mean, just pluck one or a few fries at a time with one hand without having to look at them. And two large fries without anything else will definitely fill me up.

While waiting for my order, I check the traffic leading into Buffalo. My eyes widen. Standstill traffic not too far west of the next service plaza. All before Buffalo. Well it's not like I have much choice, the question becomes do I want to wait till this subsides or just solder on through. I decide to just solder on through, and by that time my order was ready.

-----

17:00. Still sitting in this standstill. The car in front of me just pulls over to the left shoulder and two men get out. One stands on the left side while the other goes into the bushes (as the median is wide and has brush growing in the middle) to take a piss. Once he finishes, they switch spots. Okaaaaaaaaaaaaaay…

Half an hour later, traffic reaches the cause of this standstill. New York State Police troopers surround one of the box vans involved, off to the right shoulder, while a tow truck picks it up. I look over and it appears much of the cargo area disappeared, most likely by fire. After the quick peek, because looking any longer just delays everyone else behind, I floor it into open road, up to just slightly over the speed limit. The joyride is short lived, as "PAY TOLL 1000 FEET" comes into view. Well that just means I have just reached Buffalo.

I am looking for Interstate 190 north. Looking for I-190 north towards the Peace Bridge. Found it, exit onto it, first leading into central Buffalo. Now looking for the exit leading towards the Peace Bridge. But I am in the wrong lane and miss the exit. Well, guess I'll take the next exit that is not an expressway of some kind. Found it.

At this point, driving through the streets of Buffalo, I remember that I need to dispose of all my garbage and that I will not have cell service in Canada until the next day. The streets are of worse condition than I would think of Buffalo but there was no time to wallow in that. The mission now is to find a gas station or somewhere to dispose of all my garbage and catch up on the group chat I missed while driving, or so I think I would just do. Finally a gas station comes into view on the left side and I pull into it. I find a spot to park in that no one would care about and just sit there for a bit.

First, dump out all the garbage. When I said "a spot that no one would care about", I really meant within a few feet of the garbage can. It is necessary to just dump anything and everything that CBSA may have suspicion about, which really just includes food and its related waste products. In this case, I still have that McDeez bag formerly containing two whole large fries which I fully chomped in the standstil on the Thruway. Dumped.

Next, check up on group chat. Nothing too interesting to describe here besides the usual banter that happens there.

The sun starts to steadily set. Obviously, when that happens, it is getting late. My Airbnb check-in time is only in another hour and fifteen. Fine, let's get to the border *now*. I switch off the SoundCloud that I had been listening to for the entire drive up to this point. Seek through the radio stations in the Buffalo/Fort Erie/Niagara market. It's all pop, rock and NPR around here. Oh whatever, it is only another two hours or so till Toronto. Oh, and how can I forget to get my green card ready for inspection at the inspection booth?

Bridge to Canada. Let's do this.

-----

CBSA: Bonjour, hello.

[I hand over my US green card inside the protective sleeve]

CBSA: I need to see your vehicle registration too. Take the card out of the holder.

[CBSA officer hands me my card back so I can take it out of the sleeve, losing the sleeve in the process. I fumble through the glove box to find the holder containing the registration and insurance cards]

CBSA: Is the radio on?

[I shut off the radio]

Me: It's off now.

[I continue searching through the glove box until I eventually find the registration and insurance cards]

CBSA: Just give me everything.

[I hand the officer my US green card and the registration and insurance cards. CBSA looks through the slip containing registration and insurance]

CBSA: This is just the insurance—oh here it is.

[CBSA officer runs all my documents through the computer]

CBSA: So what are you doing in Canada today?

Me: Going to ride on the velodrome in Milton, visit some national parks and see some friends for one week.

CBSA: Is this your first time in Canada?

Me: Will be my third time.

CBSA: And will you be visiting friends, family on this trip?

Me: Yes, I will be seeing my friends at the end of the week. They all live in Toronto.

CBSA: How do you know them?

Me: They visited the US previously, specifically in New York and North Carolina. They were friends of my other friends originally, and they always had to come down to the US whenever we would plan gatherings. This time it's our turn to come to Canada.

CBSA: Where's home for you?

Me: Western suburb of Philadelphia.

CBSA: What do you do for a living?

Me: I'm a self-employed computing consultant.

CBSA: Will you be looking for or performing any work on this trip?

Me: I will not be working. I have enough to do as-is.

CBSA: Why are you so nervous?

Me: I didn't expect like two of these questions rapid-fire. Plus I know you have to be suspicious of everything until proven otherwise.

CBSA: Well you should expect me to ask you anything!

[pause]

CBSA: Any firearms with you today?

Me: No firearms.

CBSA: Any items of self-defence?

Me: No items of self-defence.

CBSA: Did you buy anything at duty-free?

Me: No duty-free.

CBSA: Thank you have a nice day.

What a sigh of relief. First time ever where I have not been sent to secondary inspection crossing into Canada. That was the scariest part of all, to make sure to convince the border officer that I would not be entering the Canadian labour market period, especially because I work for my own company. I pull away from the inspection booth to proceed to the toll plaza for the Peace Bridge, raise my E-ZPass transponder to the windscreen to assess the bridge toll, then immediately take the first exit in Fort Erie. First exit, because, Queen Elizabeth Way.

It is dead in the streets of Fort Erie at 19:00. Once at the end of the offramp, I made a snap decision to turn right in search of any at least semi-deserted parking lot to catch up on text messages if I still have service. I assumed that Verizon Wireless would cut off immediately at the border, but when I pulled into a parking lot for some Ontario-licensed realtor office, I discovered that I still had 3G. Enough to get textual messages and slower image and video downloads.

Before I left the parking lot to get back onto the QEW towards Toronto, I mulled over whether I wanted to continue pressing my luck with commercial radio stations or try to stream as much SoundCloud as I could before service completely cut off. Before I left on this trip, I activated Verizon's international pass, which allows use of my existing plan as if I was still on Verizon's network despite using Bell or Rodgers or whoever's network outside the US. It would not be activated for the rest of this night, hence this pondering. I elected to continue pressing my luck with the radio stations, knowing full well that the music played may very all be pop. I guess I can deal with it for the last two or three hours on the road. I also remembered to update my Airbnb host on my whereabouts, as I would arrive much later than what I had put on the reservation.

Onwards to Toronto.

-----

I was almost positive that given my Airbnb host's name, he is of Chinese descent.

More than three hours later, which included getting lost in the Scarborough section of Toronto for a bit, I finally pull up in front of the house. The lights were on and the doors unlocked, but no one was around. I decide to walk in anyway in hopes of finding a soul.

Immediately I start looking for the wifi information, as I still have no service on my phone. As the Airbnb app can only operate over the internet, that was what I needed to let the host know that I have finally arrived. Luckily, this host has been extremely thorough with making sure everyone is well taken care of, and has the wifi information on so many pieces of paper around the house. I did not want to stray much from the living room and main kitchen before the host or anyone else showed up for that matter, as a couple, presumably one of the other guests in this house, rolls back in. I ask them if they knew anything about where all the rooms are located, but they rightfully could not be of much help, as their rooms were straight ahead. But back to the wifi. I successfully connect my phone to the wifi and immediately message the host.

Five minutes later, the host rolls up in his Porsche Cayenne. "Oh you're a Chinese person!" he exclaims excitedly. I guess there are not that many ethnically Chinese people who roll through on Airbnb, as WeChat is a bit more prevalent in the ethnically Chinese communities around the world. We communicated exclusively in Chinese from that initial exclamation.

He immediately starts showing me where my room is, how to use everything that I need and even provided brand new body wash and shampoo for the bathroom. Then I told him that I need to unload my bikes somewhere indoors, so he offered a spot in the living room flanked by chairs so they would stay upright. Good enough for now.

"If you need anything, feel free to message me. I live only 250 metres away on the next street over. Good night!"

-----

I crossed the border with no food or drink save twenty bottles of water. It is now the next morning, and I should stock up on some food for this week to be consumed entirely before crossing back into the United States. But first, get some breakfast, as shopping on an empty stomach always results in bad news. I locate a breakfast/brunch spot only a few blocks away and check out their menu online. Good enough, I am going there.

I get myself some bacon, fried eggs over hard and home fries. The rest is history.

Next, since I was not hip to any particularly Canadian or Torontonian grocery stores, I veered towards the familiar, which was Walmart.
